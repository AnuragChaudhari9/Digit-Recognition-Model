# Digit-Recognition-Model
In this project, I have used Neural Networks to build a model that can recognize digits of size 28 X 28 pixels.
I have then run this model on the sample digits I created in MS Paint. These are put in the Digits folder.
This model can further be improved and fit into an app that can scan and recognize digits.
