The model has 99.33% sparse_categorial_accuracy after 15th epoch on the training set. However, its sparse_categorial_accuracy on the test set is 97.88%
The model shows accuracy of 83.33% on the sample digits used here. It is a decent accuracy for a basic NN model, considering the small amount of samples available.
However, this will be improved further by studying the variance and bias values, and checking for possibilities overfitting. The algorithm can be improved further by adding more units in the dense layers.
